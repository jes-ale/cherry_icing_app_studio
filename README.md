GUI WEB APP BUILDER
ambitious web app builder 
should support mobile multiplatform apps with capacitor and the ionic ui framework (ofc create more ui components)
Use leptos and rust for performance
Should include code snipets (i guess vanilla js) to populate prebuilt ui data-components as tables or cards.
Should include a datasources module.
Should include a component builder module.
Still not sure if should use vanilla html css js prebuilt components, or web components, gotta do some research.
this is still a green pasture.
